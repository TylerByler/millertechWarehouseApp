CODE TO REFACTOR INTO COMPONENTS/FUNCITONS
1: SEARCH FUNCTION (in search, slotEditTile, and itemEditTile)


POSSIBLE OPTIMIZATIONS FOR FUTURE
1: Use string.includes() for searching
2: Store items and slots alphabetically with 2d array
3: Use repository to store items and slots (use createContext() and useContext())
4: !!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE REFACTOR DATA STORAGE AND SEPARATE SLOT ID, SLOT QUANTITY, AND SLOT STATUSES (ex. slotEditTile) !!!!!!!!!!!!!
